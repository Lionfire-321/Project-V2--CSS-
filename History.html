        <h4>The History of Żurrieq</h4>
        <div class="image-container">
            <h5> 
                Żurrieq was inhabited since the bronze age by a relatively large population. The largest village in the area, 
                it is also the centre of most of its commercial activities and offers a number of interesting sites. The first 
                historical reference to this village goes back in 1399. The villages of Ħal Lew, Ħal Millieri, Ħal Manin, 
                Bubaqra, Ħal Far, Nigret and Qrendi used to make part of the village itself, until in 1618 the village of Qrendi 
                became a village of its own right while the others dissolved in a natural way with their area now making an 
                integral part of the village perimeter. Lying further away from the main village centre there are two other 
                hamlets, Bubaqra and in-Nigret.

        <h4>Origins of the name 'Żurrieq'</h4>
        <p>
            The Semitic roots indicate the word żoroq would mean blue, but it is not clear for what do they refer. 
            One may recall the old motto in Latin saying: From the blue sea I took my name.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Population</h4>
        <p>
            In 1530, the population numbered 2,000 people living in 400 houses. This phenomenon kept growing up till the 
            present times when we find a population of 10,000 people residing in the actual town of Zurrieq.

        <h4>Parish Church & Surroundings</h4>
        <div class="image-container">

            <h5> 
                The Parish Church dedicated to St. Catherine of Alexandria knows its roots to a chapel built on the same site 
                in 1436 by Mons. De Mello. The church we know today is that built on both the site of the chapel dedicated to 
                St. Catherine as well as an adjacent one dedicated to St. Peter. This was built between 1634 and 1659 on the 
                plans of architect Lorenzo Gafa'. Inside the church we find six paintings by Mattia Preti. Before the present 
                titular painting, there was one by Matteo Perez D'Alecio, presently in the church cloister.
                <br><br>
                There are other paintings by renowned artists such as Luca Garnieri, Frangisku Zahra, Raffael Bonnici Calì and 
                Alfred Camilleri Cauchi.
                <br><br>
                In the peripheral area of Zurrieq known as Hal Millieri, one can also find two other chapels, one of which 
                dating from medieval times and having interesting frescoes.

        <h4>Archeology</h4>
        <p>
            Zurrieq is the site of various archaeological remains dating back from various periods. Phoenician tombs were 
            discovered in the land known as " Ta' Danieri " limits of "Tal-Hlewwa". In the area known as "Tal-Bakkari", 
            ruins were unearthed of a chapel, built on even older remains of what may be a Roman temple. Some metres from 
            this sight there are ruins of one of the towers referred to as 'Torri tal-Bakkari', constructed out of the same 
            type and size of stone as those found in the chapel's ruins.
            <br><br>
            Near the Xarolla Windmill, Paleo-Christian tombs were found and are being excavated. In these tombs there are 
            interesting architectural features rarely found in similar tombs on the island.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Tax-Xarolla Windmill</h4>
        <div class="image-container">
            <h5> 
                The Xarolla Windmill at Żurrieq, Malta is one of the windmills constructed by the Order of St. John in the 
                villages and towns of Malta. It was built in the 18th-century and is presently one of the most preserved 
                windmills in Malta. The windmill is an agri-tourism attraction and is found in a complex of agricultural 
                buildings such as a farmhouse, a chapel, catacombs and others. The windmill is also used as an art studio.
                <br><br>
                In 1674 Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner built five windmills around Malta, one of which was tax-Xarolla. 
                Tax-Xarolla Windmill was built by Grand Master Antonio Manoel de Vilhena in 1724. Sometimes after 1998, 
                this was restored to its original working order. It is now the only functioning windmill on the islands of 
                Malta. This is a valuable witness of local culture and heritage; it still has parts of the original mechanisms 
                and can still grind the wheat. In the year 2000, this building was passed over to be administered by the Żurrieq 
                Local Council and is intended to serve also as a cultural centre. The sails were extensively damaged in a gale on 
                18 March 2022.

        <h4>Palaces</h4>
        <p>
            The Nigret palace was built in 1715 by Chev. Giacobo de Togores. Today the palace serves as a convent and 
            orphanage run by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart. Another interesting palace is situated in the Bubaqra zone 
            and is currently owned by a foreign family.
        </p>
        
        <h4>The Armoury</h4>
        <p>
            The palace of the Armoury was built in the XVIIth century and was used as such under Grandmasters Pinto, 
            Ximenes and de Rohan. It is said that Napoleon Bonaparte visited the village of Zurrieq and slept for a night 
            in this palace.
