                Pietru Pawl Saydon
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Pietru Pawl Saydon (24 July 1895 – 22 March 1971), was a Roman Catholic priest and scholar of the Maltese<br>
                language, other semitic languages and the Bible. He was President of the Maltese Language Society (Ghaqda <br>
                tal-Malti) at the University of Malta. He is most noteworthy for his contributions to the Maltese language, <br>
                and the translation of the Bible from the original Hebrew to Maltese.<br>

                Early years
                Saydon was born on 24 July 1895, in Żurrieq.[1] He went to the local primary school, before enrolling in the <br>
                national Seminary. In 1912 he took a preparatory course in Literature at the University of Malta, and qualified <br>
                with B.Litt. at the age of 20. in 1919, he qualified with a degree in Canonical Law, and a subsequent Doctorate <br>
                in Theology. Having come top of class, he was granted a Governmental scholarship to be able to continue his <br>
                studies abroad. In 1919 he was also ordained as a priest, and the following year left for the Pontifical Biblical <br>
                Institute in Rome, where he obtained a Licence in Holy Scriptures in 1923.<br>

                Mattia Preti
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Born in the small town of Taverna in Calabria, Preti was called Il Cavalier Calabrese (the Calabrian Knight) <br>
                after appointment as a Knight of the Order of St. John (Knights of Malta) in 1660.[1] His early apprenticeship <br>
                is said to have been with the "Caravaggist" Giovanni Battista Caracciolo, which may account for his lifelong <br>
                interest in the style of Caravaggio.<br>
                Probably before 1630, Preti joined his brother Gregorio (also a painter), in Rome, where he became familiar with <br>
                the techniques of Caravaggio and his school as well as with the work of Guercino, Rubens, Guido Reni, and <br>
                Giovanni Lanfranco. In Rome, he painted fresco cycles in the churches of Sant'Andrea della Valle and San Carlo <br>
                ai Catinari. Between 1644 and 1646, he may have spent time in Venice,[2] but remained based in Rome until 1653, <br>
                returning later in 1660–61. He painted frescoes for the church of San Biagio at Modena (app. 1651–2) and <br>
                participated in the fresco decoration of the Palazzo Pamphilj in Valmontone (documented 1660–61), where he <br>
                worked along with Pier Francesco Mola, Gaspar Dughet, Francesco Cozza, Giovanni Battista Tassi (il Cortonese), <br>
                and Guglielmo Cortese.<br><br>

                The residence in Triq il-Fjuri in Żurrieq was once owned by the great painter Mattia Preti (1613-1699). He had <br>
                spent the last 40 years of his life in Malta – first staying in Valletta and later on moving to this house from <br>
                where a number of great works of art were made.
