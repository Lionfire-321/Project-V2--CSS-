            <br><br>
            Żurrieq is one of the first 10 parishes documented in 1436 and it is dedicated to Saint Catherine.
            The island of Filfla is administratively a part of the town. The town stretches from Nigret to Ħal Far.
            In old times the town had a border with Żejtun. The village of Qrendi used to be part of the parish
            of Żurrieq until 1618 when it was made into its own parish.
